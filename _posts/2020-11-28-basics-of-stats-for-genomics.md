### p-value and null-hypothesis 


  P-value = P($$ S^n $$ more extreme than $$ S^0 $$ ```|``` null-distribution)

  $$ S^0 $$ : evaluated for how extreme it is 

  $$ S^n $$ : random variable generated from the null distribution 

  Null Distribution : The distribution of observed or expected $$ S^n $$ given that the null hypothesis is true. 


- The P-value is the probability of observing your test statistic or a statistic more extreme than it given that it was drawn from the null distribution.

- P-value caluclation based on the the random sample used. The more people we sample the more accurate will be our p-value. 

- A very small p-value means that such an extreme observed outcome would be very unlikely under the null hypothesis.

- But remember p-value doesn't say anything about the alternate hypothesis, it only talks about validity of null hypothesis. 

***Null Distribution ***

- Assumed distribution would rarely match exactly with the emperical distribution

- Normal distribution is the most used Null distribution
