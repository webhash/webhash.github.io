## Basics of Genome

- Human Genome is double helix shaped, made of two strands, both are connected via pairs of nucleotides, called **DNA**

 - Four type of nucleotides in DNA 
```
  1. A - Adenine 
  2. T - Thymine 
  3. C - Cytosine 
  4. G - Guanine 
```
- A will always be connected to T

- C will always be connected to G 

- Together A-T and C-G are called basepairs

- So if we know nucleobases arrangement of one strand, we can tell its counterpart strand's arrangement

- Human DNA is approximatly 3 billion basepair long

- DNA is not one long strand, but contains chunks of 23 chromosomes

- Chromosomes in humans can be divided into two types: autosomes (body chromosome) and allosome (sex chromosome).

- 22 of the choromosomes are of autosomes type and 23rd one is allosome.  

- Some chromosomes are big, some are small. 


## Human genetics 

- Humans carry two copy of DNA, we belong to the diploid cataegory 

- Once copy from each parent 

- Each copy will be unique

- One strand from each of the two DNAs is used to represent the genetic code 

- Haplotype is the specific arrangement of nucleotides in the region of a specific chromosome 

- As we have two pair of DNAs, we compare same chromosome, say no 22, and haplotype is used to talk about the difference between the two 
 
- Genotype for a specific individual is the genetic code like at a specific location on same chromosome from the two DNAs inherited  

- Humans have almost 99.9 % same genetics, only 0.1% is different 


## Genetic variation 

- Single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP is the variation at same location on two DNA strands

- Indel is an insertion or deletion of bases in the genome of an organism

- Structrual variation is group name of various complex differences in genome

- We often use different terms for same/similiar concepts in genetics. 

- Variant is catch all word for any difference in genome. 

- Mutation is used for things that are rarely seen or when first time a change is seen, change itself can either be SNP, Indel or Structrual  

- Allele is the specific variation that we see, it doesn't concern with the location of the change but the change itself. 


## Genotyping and Sequencing 

 - We have two approaches to get the inforation about the variations 
 
 **Genotyping**
 
 - This is a cheap technology, usually comes in form of a chip 
 
 - Probes limited number of known variants like SNPs, indels etc
 
 - Only look for already known variants 
 
 **Sequencing**
 
 - Costier when compaterd to genotyping, but it is also getting cheaper 
 
 - Reads entire genome , or portion of genome and thus finds the knowns and unknowns 


## Phased and Unphased 

- Both genotyping and sequencing gives unphased data , i.e. we just know which haplotype result refers to 

- All we know is the two nucleotides values seen, but not their respective haplotype, represented by ```C/C``` , i.e. by slash 

- When we know to which haplotype does values in pair belongs to, we can say that result is phased and represented by ```C|C```, i.e by vertical bar

- One way to convert unphased data to phased data is by use of family data, i.e by sequening the parents of the subject.

- Easy way is to use computers and apply algorithms to detect the correct phase
