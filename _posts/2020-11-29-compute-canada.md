### Compute Canada 

- Has multiple server located through out canada and is built for researchers and universities to do their research work 

- We login using SSH and lands on a login node

- Computer canada uses SLURM scheduling system 

- We should always use the scheduler to submit jobs 

- Exceptions are made for compilation and other tasks not expected to consume more than about 10 CPU-minutes and about 4 gigabytes of RAM, such tasks can run on login node

- A job submitted won't necessarily start immediately, as the schedular would decide when to run the job
